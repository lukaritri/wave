## Core Features (v1)

- Countdown timer
- Settings
- Local storage persistence
- Clean and minimal styling

## Technical Highlights

- State management with React hooks
- LocalStorage for persistence without backend
- Structured components for scalability

## Motivation

Many existing productivity tools are either cluttered and overwhelming or visually uninspiring. Wave was created to be calm and distraction-free combinging minimal interface design with intentional visual details to enhance focus.

This project is also for me to explore:

- Product thinking
- UI/UX design
- Front-end development

## Tech Stack

- React
- Typescript
- CSS
- Vercel (deployment)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/lukaritri/wave.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run locally
npm run dev
```

## Status

v1 complete - iterative improvements and feature expansion in progress.

## Currently Working On

- [x] Timer settings
- [ ] Simple wave animation

- [x] Deployment

## Future Ideas

- Break/pomodoro mode
